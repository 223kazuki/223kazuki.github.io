title: kafka-streamsで状態管理
description: "Recently, I tried Lacinia because many clojurians and companies begin to use it. It's one of the most exciting clojure library today. I'm very fascinated by it. But while developing Lacinia application, I also met some difficulties. In this post, I introduce how I resolved those difficulties as Tips for lacinia app development.

As I don't intend to introduce Lacinia itself, I don't explain what Lacinia is. Please read [Lacinia document](https://lacinia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and try tutorial first."
